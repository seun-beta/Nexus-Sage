## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

Nexus Sage is designed to provide quick and accurate responses to queries related to Nexus Inc.'s employee handbook. By leveraging Elasticsearch for data storage and retrieval and OpenAI's GPT for response generation, Nexus Sage ensures that employees can access the information they need efficiently.

The project consists of several components:
- A FastAPI server that handles incoming requests and routes them to the appropriate services.
- An Elasticsearch instance that stores the employee handbook data and supports efficient querying.
- An integration with OpenAI's GPT model to generate responses based on the retrieved data.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Elasticsearch instance
- OpenAI API key

### Installing

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/seun-beta/nexus-sage.git
    cd nexus-sage
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment and activate it:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Set up environment variables in a `.env` file:**
    ```plaintext
    ELASTIC_SEARCH_HOST=<your_elasticsearch_host>
    ELASTIC_SEARCH_USER=<your_elasticsearch_username>
    ELASTIC_SEARCH_PASSWORD=<your_elasticsearch_password>
    ELASTIC_SEARCH_INDEX_NAME=nexus_sage
    OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_openai_api_key>
    ```

### Elasticsearch Setup

1. **Create the Elasticsearch index:**
    ```bash
    python create_index.py
    ```

2. **Load data into the Elasticsearch index:**
    ```bash
    python load_data.py
    ```

3. **(Optional) Delete the Elasticsearch index:**
    ```bash
    python delete_index.py
    ```

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

To use the system, start the FastAPI server and interact with the endpoints.

1. **Start the FastAPI server:**
    ```bash
    uvicorn api:app --reload
    ```

2. **The API will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.**

### Endpoints

- **Health Check:** `GET /`
  - Returns: `{"data": "PONG!"}`

- **Query:** `POST /query`
  - Request Body:
    ```json
    {
      "query": "Your question here"
    }
    ```
  - Returns: `{"data": "Generated response based on the handbook"}`
